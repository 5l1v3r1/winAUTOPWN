Its a mandatory ultratag to notify WELF that the exploit script for the particular
exploit has finished and it can now parse the next one.

Anything other than ^^^^ and the listed tags in WELF_TERMINOLOGIES.TXT will be directly considered as a part of the commandline.

Do keep WELF_TERMINOLOGIES.TXT handy.
