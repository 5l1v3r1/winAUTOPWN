So far I have been able to enlist the following exploit files which get deleted by Windows Defender Service while extracting WINDOWS AUTOPWN from the archive file on Windows 8 (Developer Preview) and also by other Anti-Virus Softwares on Windows 7 and maybe below.

=========================================================
rpcdcom.exe
pwn_isapi.exe
MX_Simulator_Server_Remote_Buffer_Overflow_Exploit.exe
mswinqueue-overflow-axis@ph4nt0m.exe
msdns_zonename_xpl.exe
ms08067.exe
MS08-067.exe
ftpdmin_v._0.96_RNFR_rem_buf_ovrflw_xplt.php
kingview-overflow.py
Samba_lt_3.0.20_Remote_Heap_Overflow_Exploit.exe
=========================================================


Stop "Windows Defender Service" and other Antivirus Softwares (if any) you will be able to extract these files successfully.
